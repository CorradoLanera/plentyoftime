# Biography

Corrado Lanera is a second year Ph.D. student of school of Specialistic
Traslational Medicine "G.B. Morgagni" at the University of Padova (Italy)
in the Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Public Health
of the Department of Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Sciences,
with a curriculum in Biostatistics.

His research activity is driven in the area of Machine Learning (ML)
and Phenomapping techniques applied to clinical science. Particular attention
is given to free-text analyses focused on:
  
  1. patient classification with or without reported infections based on
     free-text fields of the Electronic Health Records;
  2. classification of papers and clinical registries' entries driven by
     researcher interest, to support the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
     processes;
  3. social media free-text analyses for health surveillance.
  
His research is also focused on the application of ML to patient's kinetic
signals from wearable devices to measure caloric intake or post-surgical
rehabilitation rate/quality
